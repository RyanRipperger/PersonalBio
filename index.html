      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
          &emsp; I was born in a town east of Sacramento known as El Dorado Hills.  It
          is about two hours from Chico.  It is located in the foothills of El Dorado
          County and in my opinion was a great place to grow up as a kid because
          there are a lot of things to do outside.
          <br><br>
          &emsp; I come from a family of 5.  I have one older sister who is attending
          school at Brigham Young University in Utah and a younger brother who is
          finishing up his senior year in highschool at Oak Ridge High School in my
          hometown of El Dorado Hills.  My sister's name is Miranda and my brother's
          name is Kevin. In addition, my mother's name is Sandy and father's name is
          Paul.  They both work as medicare database managers for programs all over the
          United State, under the employment of HP.
          <br><br>
          &emsp; Although most may not care, but I also have 3 pets back at home in
          EDH.  I have two cats named Tigger and Puffle as well as one dog named
          Molly.  (:

      <h3>Previous Education</h3>
      <P>
        &emsp; Before attending to Chico State, I went to my local highschool named
        Oak Ridge High School.  It was a very good school with a lot of good teachers
        who cared about their job and wanted their students to learn.  At Oak Ridge
        I took my first computer science course and i was very difficult for me.
        The teacher, was not a very good teacher at all.  She knew what she was
        talking about but did not know how to teach it at all.  However, in her defense
        there was no in-between for computer science classes at the school.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; The course that I took was AP Computer Science which was based around
        learning JavaScript.  I did not want to take an AP class for comp sci since I
        was not experienced in coding but it was the only option.  That is the main reason
        why I am taking CINS 110 because even though I took that class and passed with
        a low C, I am still a beginner at coding and I testing the water to see if
        I want to persue a career in coding.

      <h3>College Education</h3>
      <P>
        &emsp; As of taking this class, I am a Freshman in my second semester at Chico State.
        I love this school because there are tons of great people all around chico and
        all of the professors I've had so far have been great people who love what
        they do.  I am undeclared and have no major and I still have no idea what
        I want to major in.  To be honest I am slightly interested in computer science
        in the realm of Network Security but I am pretty bad at coding so it all depends
        on how successful I am in this class.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; I definitely hope that I can find a major and graduate within four years,
        I know that its difficult but I do not want to make my parents spend any more
        than they already do.  I am lucky that they are nice enough to support my
        college education and I don't want to waste anymore money than I need to because
        next year, all three of my siblings and I will be in college which is a crap
        ton of money!
