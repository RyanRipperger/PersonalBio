              This was the first HTML project that I made for CINS - 110.  I was
              placed in the group named after the famous Computer Scientist, Danese
              Cooper.  The website describes 3 facts about the Cooper as well as
              describing something that I like to do for fun.

              This was a lab to find problems in a set of code and fix the errors
              so that the code would validate.  In addition, after the errors were
              corrected and the code validated, it was practice using the
              GitKraken tool to find the files on our computer and push it up to
              a repository in GitHub.  At a later date, we also used this file to
              practice manipulating the style of the text using CSS.

              This Repo was part of an in-class activity.  In the activity, we practiced
              using an external CSS file.  In this activity, we were given a
              basic HTML file and practiced using classes to manipulate the text
              and look of the web page.

            <li>
              In this lab we were given a template for a filling out information
              about a movie of our choice.  I chose the James Cameron's Avatar
              and filled out movie relating to the movie itself as well as
              cast members in the movie.  At the end of the file, I filled out
              a section about the plot.  We used Pseudo-Classes to make it so if
              you hover your mouse above a section of the plot, a spolier would be
              revealed.

              This is the repo for my first project in CINS-110.  It is a Personal
              Bio website that is testing our ability to create a website without
              following instructions.  The website has 4 pages: The intro page,
              a page about our interests, our history in computer science, as well as
              our portfolio.

              This repository is practice making tabs in HTML using CSS.  In this
              lab we linked multiple pages together and when you click on one, it will
              take you to that specific page.  There was also additional practice
              working with pseudo-classes and when you hover over text and the background
              color changes.
