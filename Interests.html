      <h3> Hobbies </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp; I have a lot of hobbies that I enjoy doing all the time.  One of my
        most favorite hobbies is building computers.  Many people are intimidated
        by even the mere idea of building a computer but it is a lot easier than
        people might think.  I built my own personal gaming rig about three years
        ago and I've loved it ever since.  I have also helped build a few of my friend's
        computers as well! I love playing video games, so building a computer made
        specifically for gaming was a huge step from PlayStation 3!  It gives me the
        power to decide what parts I want to put in my computer.

        &emsp; During middle school I also used to spend a lot of time outside
        driving my RC Car.  These cars weren't just regular RC cars that you can
        pick up at Target.  These cars were sold at the local hobby shop and costed
        around $300 depending on how fast you wanted it to go.  My friends and I used
        to take our cars to the school to drive them around but we also found fields
        where we made jumps for them to go off of!

        &emsp; Another hobby that I enjoy is going outside and hiking or
        mountain biking.  This is one of the great things that I love about going
        to Chico State is the huge amount of National Parks in the area.  Bidwell
        Park is a beautiful place to go to enjoy nature.  It's good sometimes to
        get off of my computer or phone and go outside and enjoy the nature all
        around the area!

      <h3> Music </h3>
      <P>
        I have a very diverse taste in music.  What I love about music is it speaks
        a little bit about who you are as a person.  What you listen to reflects
        your thoughts and memories as a person.  As I meet more and more people,
        I like to get a taste of their type of music to try and understand who they
        are a person.
        <br><br>
        <b>Here is some of the music that I listen to:</b>

      <ul style="color:black;">
        <li> Keane </li>
        <li> Rebelution </li>
