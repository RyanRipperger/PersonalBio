      <h3> Previous Coding Experience </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp; The only previous experience with coding/computer science that I hads was in
        High School.  My senior year I took AP Computer Science.  It was a class
        based on the JavaScript coding language.  The class was not completely
        impossible, but it was fairly difficult.  Especially since it was my very
        first exposure to coding, I had a hard time understanding some of the
        concepts.  The teacher was not very helpful and she was not very easy to
        approach to ask questions which is one of the reasons I did so poorly.  I
        did learn a lot about coding and what it entails but I really wish I took
        the class more seriously and perhaps I would have done better in the end.

      <h3> Motivations for CINS - 110 </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp; Why did I take CINS - 110?  Becuase of the bad experience I had with
        coding in High School I wanted to make sure that I for sure did not
        enjoy coding.  I want to believe that deep down, I enjoy coding because I
        really enjoy computers and technology.  Coding is an essential aspect to
        how all of that works. I believe that I had a badintroduction to the
        world of computer science.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; The main reason that I took this class in web developement was
        that this is a different realm of coding in a certain respect.  This is
        more front-end coding or something you can visually see when you create
        your code.  Java is more back-end coding or what the code is doing in the
        background that you may not see with your eyes.  I feel that exposure can
        help me determine what path of computer science that I want to go down if
        I were to persue a career/major in Computer Science.
        <br><br>
        &emsp; Coding gives users the creativity to do what they want with their computers.  The possibilities are
        endless.  Especially in the digital age that we live in, there are also
        opportunities to make a good bit of money.  Jobs pay a lot of money for
        someone who knows how to code and when choosing a job, it is more likely
        that the person with experience in coding to get the job over someone who
        does not.
